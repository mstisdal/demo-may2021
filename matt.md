# The power of open science *(template for you to play with)*

These [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_2ybhWlbg_Y_NrTQ_FF8JqqmbsstCkt5IKZqHmwDtFg/edit?usp=sharing) from March 2021 give a 15-minute overview of our NASA-Openscapes project. We now also have a website: <https://nasa-openscapes.github.io>.

Here is a table with some collaborators *(tables use `|`s and `-`s to separate columns and rows)*:


Name | Twitter | GitHub

Erin | [@connector_erin](https://twitter.com/connector_erin) | [@erinmr](https://github.com/erinmr)
Amanda |  | [@amandatan](https://github.com/amandatan)

Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 

I also talked about GitHub for science â€“ and can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` (From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).
